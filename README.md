<b>A lightweight Javascript library to work with (nn / mn) matrix, vector and numerical methods.</b>

<h4> Hello everyone, I am a self-taught js programmer who loves to code and solve math-related problems with js. </h4>

<p> I am developing this library in my free time and to boost my knowledge of programming. Haven't learned algorithms yet, so my code is not so efficient. I will try to make it efficient and refactor the code after finishing the library.</p>

<h3> Meanwhile, you are welcome to contribute to this library and help me refactor the code. </h3>
